      <p class="text-body1 q-mt-sm">
        A user’s profile is built based on the information collected from the
        signup form and in case of filmmakers, the additional details are
        collected from his film’s submission form. All requests to “add as a
        crew” must be approved by the filmmaker. Moviepedia Films reserves the
        right to delete/alter any profile if any false/fraudulent information is
        provided by the user.

      <div class="text-h3 q-mt-md text-primary">1.2. Film Submission</div>
      <p class="text-body1 q-mt-sm">
        Only a person associated with the film can submit the film. The
        submitted film should not violate copyright law as per mentioned on the
        film’s hosting site. If Moviepedia Films finds such content, it reserves
        the right to forfeit the entire entry fee paid during film submission.
        Only the films that make the cut during initial review by Moviepedia
        Content Curation Team will be forwarded to the celebrity jury panel.
        Moviepedia Films does not reserve any liability to forward the film to
        the celebrity jury panel. Every film submitted will be screened for 15
        days. During this period, the audience will be watching and rating the
        film which is being screened. Subtitles in English are mandatory for all
        films. Any submission without subtitles will be given 48 hours to add
        subtitles from the date of notice. If not updated within a given time,
        the film will not be screened and the entire fee paid would be
        forfeited.
